“I…I’m fine honey, really,” Joe sighed. I’m just ti-”

 

“Fine? 

Fine?

 Is that what you call fine?” Jill hissed. “Because I call it a red wave in November! I call it a one-term presidency!”

 

“Jill, please,” Joe mumbled. “Can we, c-can we just save the malarkey for another time?”  

 

“Joe,” his harpy of a wife stated firmly. “You need to remember what the speech therapist told you. Remember to breathe properly. Take your time. And enunciate. Remember? E-nun-cee-” 

 

“What the hell was that Joe?” an unmistakable voice shouted. 

 

Donald Trump walked into the backstage breakroom like he owned the place. Which, knowing him, he very well may have. As Joe watched him swagger into the room, even he had to begrudgingly admit that, while the 45th lacked many decent traits, presence was never one of them. He had long been baffled by how his rival could so easily capture the attention of millions - whether positive or negative - and felt self-conscious of how milquetoast and lackluster he seemed in comparison. 

 

“Donald,” Jill said tersely. “How nice to see you.”

 

“I need to have a word with your husband for a moment. Just a moment, it won’t be long.” Donald gestured towards the door. “Please.” 

 

Joe, who had been staring off into the distance for the last minute, suddenly blinked and opened his eyes wide in shock, looking at Donald’s face. He thought that he had just heard him say “Please.” But The Don’s eyes were resolute, lips pursed. He looked serious. 

 

Dr. Biden huffed, glaring at the Orange Man with a hand on her hip. After a couple of seconds, she turned and left without saying a word, joining the Secret Service agents standing outside, watching a whole mess of staffers and aides scurrying around the room, answering phone calls and fielding urgent messages. 

 

As the door swung shut, Donald slid into the seat across from Joe. He looked directly into his eyes for a few heartbeats.

 

“I mean seriously Sleepy Joe, what the fuck was that?” 

 


That accent suits him so well, 

Joe thought. 

 

“Did they not pump enough adrenochrome into you this morning?” Donald continued. “No but really, what do they have you on? Adderall? Vyvance? Cause you need to tell the docs to up the dosage. I mean, I have seen a lot of public speaking, a lot. Believe me, I don’t think anyone has ever seen as much public speaking as I have. That was the biggest failure, the yugest, most terrible act of public speaking that I have ever seen in my entire life.” 

 

Joe sighed in defeat. “Did you come here just to gloat, Donald?”

 

Donald leaned in just a bit closer. “No,” he said. “I’m going to be serious with you Joe. I’m really worried about you. I mean that from the bottom of my heart.” 

 

“Give me a break, man.”

 

“I’m serious Joe. I swear it on my whole family. I’m seriously worried about you, and I’m worried for you.”

 

Joe stared back at him in silence. Donald’s words sounded almost sincere to him. His gaze held those sky-grey eyes and could find no malice within them. 

 

“What do you mean by that, Donald?”

 

“I want to know if you’re OK, that’s all. How are you holding up? Because, you know, a lot of people have been telling me that they’re not treating you like a president should be treated back there. That they’re not treating you very well. You know, giving you all these shots, and feeding you all this slop, and all this other stuff going on, I mean, just tell me yourself Joe, how are they treating you these days?”

 

“Well, that’s a load of bull,” Joe scoffed. “And, and besides, even if say they were, do you think I’d go telling you of all people?” 

 

Donald nodded slightly, his eyes casting downwards.

 

“Joe, I think you just told me all I need to know.”

 

“Nonsense. Now if that’s all, look, I have a plane to catch-”





Donald shot a hand out, holding onto Joe’s wrist. 

 

“I think Air Force One can wait for you Joe, they’re not going to take off without you,” Donald chuckled. “I want to help you, seriously, I mean…” He released his wrist. “It would be the best for the country. To have a president who is in good shape, I mean. I know a lot of smart people, incredible people, hardworking doctors and trainers and medics and all sorts of wonderful health professionals, and they’ll do a million times of a better job than those phony docs they’re giving you, I mean you wouldn’t believe what kind of garbage they’re doing these days. Listen, I’ve been talking to Bobby Kennedy, and the malpractice they’re doing these days is unbelievable, I mean frankly some of these quacks ought to be locked up I tell ya. Now these people will have you feeling thirty years younger, maybe even 40, who knows? They do a lot of things that might sound a little crazy at first - eggs, raw eggs are involved, and raw milk too, and all of that, but it really works, believe me. How else do you think I can do 7 rallies in 2 days? No one else would know, and I sure as hell won’t tell anybody, I mean could you imagine the headlines if the lying fake news media started saying that ‘oh I helped the Democrats?’ Nobody will know but us.” 

 

Joe pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed a long sigh. 

 

“Donald, I appreciate your concern. But I assure you that the White House doctors are top-of-the-line and the absolute best in their field. Now if you’ll excuse me, I honestly do have an appointment I need to meet.” 

 

Joe stood, buttoned his suit, and extended a hand. 

 

Donald stood and firmly clasped his hand. “Alright. Well, take care, Joe. I’ll have my people send you a list of names and some quality nutrients and vitamins and supplements and the like.” 

 

Then, Donald tugged on his arm, pulling him close, and spoke into his ear.

 

“You know what Joe? I'd miss you. If something happened to you, or if they did something to you. If they take you away. It’s supposed to be us.” 

 

Donald relinquished his hand and turned to walk out of the room. At the threshold, he turned back to look one more time at the bewildered commander-in-chief. 

 

“I really do want to play that round of golf with you one day, Joe.” 

 

And just like that, he was off. 

 
 

Those words flashed through Joe’s mind as he looked down at the red baseball cap in his shaking hands. It has 

his 

name on it, the name which had branded itself upon every last fleeting moment of lucidity he had left. Its lettering is bold, gaudy, and obnoxious - how fitting, he thought.  


“Put it on!” yells someone, somewhere within the crowd of mainly tweens and senior citizens. “Put it on!”

 

“I ain’t goin’ that far,” Joe shot back with an incredulous smile. No, no. That wouldn’t be a good idea…right?

 

And yet, Joe found himself looking around the room, gauging the audience while he licked his lips. The urge was irresistible.

 


Ah, fuck it. 


 

The firehouse erupted with cheers and applause as Joe placed the TRUMP 2024 cap atop his own. And as he shook hands with the retired firefighter seated in front of him, he wore the widest, most genuine smile he had in a long time. 

 

He hadn’t felt this kind of joy in years. 

 
 

“Your Long Island Ice Tea, sir.”

 

Joe savored his cocktail. He grinned a nearly imperceptible grin as he read over the brief, scattered statement he had written, scribbled across the back of an envelope. As the world began to fade at the edges, he steadied his face, hit record, and began to speak. A limp American flag droops above his right shoulder as he speaks. 

 

“-well let me tell ya summin’, I don't, I-I-I- don’t know the Puerto Rican that, that I know, or a Puerto Rico where I’m fr-, in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see out there is his supporters,” he spat. “His, his, his demonization a thing uh is unconscionable, and it’s un-American, it’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.” 

 

He continued on, the thin tunnel of lucidity shrinking ever smaller, until he finally reached the end. He glanced over at his intern and gave her a nod, ignoring the look of severe concern she wore. She sighed a tired sigh and began the upload. 

 

Joe left the small building and walked down to the beachfront, past the quaint colonial townhomes and squat beach houses. His Secret Service detail and minders were wearing swim trunks and Hawaiian t-shirts. He appreciated their decorum. 

 

Along the way, he passed by a beach bar, and on one of the TVs suspended from the ceiling, he spotted his Vice President campaigning at some Midwest town. 

 

Joe looked away. He could no longer bear to look for more than a few seconds anymore. He continued on his slow meander and weakly clenched his fist.

 

“Give them hell, Donnie.” 

 

He retired to his reclined seat by the beachside. There, his eyes full of frosted light, he watched as the brilliant orange sun dipped into the ocean, turning every crest of every wave into a shimmering sheet of diamonds and gold. 

 
 

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. lies in his bed. 

 

His wife enters to place an absentee ballot by his bedside, whispers a few words to him, and then leaves to join his son and daughter outside. 

 

After a couple of minutes, slowly, Joe grasps his fountain pen and begins to bubble in the circle next to a name. Sinatra croons from the nearby turntable. 

 

………………………………………………………………

 

For President of the United States (Vote for One)

 

⚪ Donald J. Trump - President

Somewhere, at some time, two men stand upon a lush, green golf course with an obscenely beautiful landscape, cross-cut by clear rushing rivers and surrounded by Alpine forest for miles in every direction. The larger one crushed the ball off the tee, sending a monster drive off into the horizon. 

 

“See that Joe? That’s how it’s done, right there. Even now you’re still the same old Sleepy Joe.” 

 

“Shove it, Jack. I’ll show you what a real rocket looks like, ya son of a bitch.”

 

 “Oh yeah, with what? With that drive that’s as crooked as you are?”

 

The two share a look for a brief moment, before breaking out into a fit of laughter. Joe began to tee. 

 

“No, no, like this.”

 

It was a pure strike, straight down the middle and arcing out of sight.

 

“Not bad, Joe, I gotta admit. Not bad.”

 

Joe turned to look at him with a peaceful grin. 

 

“You know, I love you man.”

 

Donald gave him a sly smile.

 

“I love you too Joe. Now, let’s go find out where the balls landed, alright?”

 

The two of them climbed into their nearby golf cart, and Joe began to drive.
