- Maybe for unit 2 I could combine formal and informal texts from online? I could compare the writing from bigger social media platforms (idk if the scraping would work on these though), and smaller ones. Or I could find older blog posts/social media and compare it to newer ones?
    - The bigger contrast in language, the better
    - Targeting texts that cover similar subjects but in different ways would also be a good idea to highlight differences in language usage
- Would need to deal with targeting specific html divs (so things like timestamps could be ignored)
- Need to deal with possible 403 status errors (maybe find a work around?)
